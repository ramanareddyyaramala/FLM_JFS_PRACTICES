	 * 
	 * even if you overloaded the main method that will take only the "main(String[] args)" only..
	 * 
	 *but not possible "overriding" ,because in public static void main(String[] args) there is a static 
	 *
	 *keyword that makes the METHODHIDING.
	 *
	 *Note:Overriding will not be possible if there is a static in a method .
	 *
	 *
	 *Note:The java class will compile without main method.
